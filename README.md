MongoDB Task
1). Download and Install the MongoDB server https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community. For windows users, you can locate your mongo and mongod .exe terminals at the bin directory in your mongodb file. The mongodb file can be found among your program files at the root directory of your computer. For mac users, here is a link on how to install and locate the mongo and mongod .exe terminals: https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/mongo-mac.html. 

You are to take a screenshot showing both .exe files stated above. This screenshot will be uploaded as part of an .md file you will push to a new repository on your github. ![MongoDB Directory](https://github.com/dyn4casie/mongodb-basics/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(250).png)

2). Write a script to connect to your mongodb database. Your database should be named after your slack username. Use underscores to replace spaces and non-alphanumeric characters that may be found in your slack name for ease. Failure to follow this naming convention will result in a loss of points. 

Run the command highlighted in our previous class to connect to your database but remember to run both your mongod.exe and mongo.exe terminals first. You should console.log “Database created by *insert your slack username*” on your terminal after successful creation. 

In that same vein, take a screenshot(s) showing that you successfully logged “Database created by *insert your slack username*” and attach to the same .md file carrying the first screenshot you provided above. ![Database Creation](https://github.com/dyn4casie/mongodb-basics/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(245).png)
3). The above were already done in class so consider this last point a challenge to have you think outside the box. Create a collection called "interns". Save it in a separate js file. You can name this file how you want and it should be different from the file you used to create your database. Running your code should console.log(“Interns collection created”) on successful collection creation. Take a screenshot showing the result of this console.log attach on the same .md file as above.  ![intern log](https://github.com/dyn4casie/mongodb-basics/blob/master/images/Screenshot%20(247).png)
4) Create a repo called “mongodb-basics” on github and push your completed task there. It is advisable to have these images attached to your README.md file so it can be the first thing anyone sees when they access your repo. You may need to do further research to find out how to create a readme file containing images. 

NOTE: It is very important I see these images and you need to make sure they show as expected before making a submission.
